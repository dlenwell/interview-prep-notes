## Linked Lists

This folder includes examples of linked lists and common methods for sorting and
reversing linked lists.

### Examples:

#### base ([code](base.py))
All of these examples are variations on the same concepts so base contains all
the common code used between the examples.

#### Reversing ([code](reverse.py))
I cannot tell you how many tech interviewers have asked me to reverse a linked
list. Lets just say its a lot. This file contains recursive and iterative 
methods.

#### Sorting
I tried to cover the most common methods here.. there are more types of sorting,
but wanted to cover the main choises.

examples included:
- [merge sort](mergesort.py)
- [quick sort](quicksort.py)
- [bubble sort](bubblesort.py)

### Race ([code](race.py))
The race code just triggers all of the examples above with the same data set
and times them for comparison.
