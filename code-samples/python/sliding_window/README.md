## Sliding Window
While solving problems that require inspecting certain aspects of some ranges
inside a given array or string of characters, the sliding window technique can
be a very powerful tool.

### Examples that involve an array of integers:

- max_sum -> (maximum sequential sum in sequence no greater than length input)
- shortest_larger_than -> (shortest sub array with sum larger than input)

### Examples that involve strings:
- longest_sub_string -> (returns the length of the longest unique substring)
- min_sub_string -> (returns the minimum substring that has all characters in the needles input)
- longest_consecutive -> (returns the length of the longest consecutive string)
