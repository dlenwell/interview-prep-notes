## Interview Prep Notes

This repo is a collection of notes and example scripts I wrote while refreshing my core comp-sci skills before going on interview loops at large tech companies that do these types of interviews.

In my research I've uncovered the top 10 concepts that will come up in these types of interviews, they are;

- logarithms
- graph traversal
  - Depth First
  - Breadth First
- binary search
- sliding window
- recursion
- inverting trees and reversing linked lists
- suffix trees
- heaps
- dyanamic programming
- quick sort

Since I am mostly a python developer most of the example code within is python but that might change.
