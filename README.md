## Interview Prep Notes

This repo is a collection of notes and example scripts I wrote while refreshing
my core comp-sci skills before going on interview loops at large tech companies
that do these types of interviews.

In my research I've uncovered the top 11 (everyone does top ten lists, this one
goes to 11) concepts that will come up in these types of interviews, they are;

- Logarithms
- Graph Traversal
- Binary Search
- Sliding Window
- Recursion
- Inverting Trees
- Reversing Linked Lists
- Suffix Trees
- Heaps
- Dynamic Programming
- Quick Sort
